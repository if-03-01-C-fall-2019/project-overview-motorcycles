            <h1>Motorcikle History</h1>
            <p>
              The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen, it was designed
              by the German inventor Gottlieb Daimeler and Wikhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt,in 1885.The early
              Motorcikle did not use the principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier.
              Instead,it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.
            </p><br>
            <p>

              The inventors called their invention the Reitwagen ("riding car"). It was designed as an expedient testbed
              for their new engine, rather than a true prototype vehicle.It was firstly built by  Merryweather Fire Engine
              company in Greenwich, in 1888.
            </p><br>
            <p>
              The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was a three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle,
              conceived of Edward Butler in England in 1884
            </p><br>
            <p>
              In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfm√ºller became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle.
              in England the Excelsior Motor Company began producing Motorcikles in 1896.

              In the 21st century, the motorcycle industry is mainly dominated by the Indian
              motorcycle industry and by Japanese motorcycle companies.In addition to the large
              capacity motorcycles, there is a large market in smaller capacity (less than 300 cc)
              motorcycles, mostly concentrated in Asian and African countries and produced in China and India
